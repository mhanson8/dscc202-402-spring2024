    "When you are designing your approach, one of the main decisions that you will need to make is how you are going to orchestrate the streaming data processing in your pipeline.  There are several valid approaches.  First, you may choose to start the bronze_stream and let it complete (read and append all of the source data) before preceeding and starting up the silver_stream.  This approach has latency associated with it but it will allow your code to proceed in a linear fashion and process all the data by the end of your notebook execution.  Another potential approach is to start all the streams and have a \"watch\" method to determine when the pipeline has processed sufficient or all of the source data before stopping and displaying results.  Both of these approaches are valid and have different implications on how you will trigger your steams and how you will gate the execution of your pipeline.  Think through how you want to proceed and ask questions if you need guidance. The following references may be helpful:\n",
